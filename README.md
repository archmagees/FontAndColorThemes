# README

My Xcode color theme, inspired from Atom One Dark.

## Usage

1. First go to the directory. 

```shell
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData
```

2. Then clone the whole repo into local. 

Make sure that there is no directory with the same name `FontAndColorThemes`. If exists, save the contents in that directory and paste them back into the `FontAndColorThemes` directory after clone.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:archmagees/FontAndColorThemes.git
```

ðŸŽ‰ Restart the Xcode. Now you can use the new theme named `Panda` in `Fonts & Colors` section in preferences.
