## Usage

1. First go to the directory. 

    ```shell
    cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData
    ```

2. Then clone the whole repo into local. 

   Make sure that there is no directory with the same name `FontAndColorThemes`. If exists, save the contents in that directory and paste them back into the `FontAndColorThemes` directory after clone.

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:archmagees/FontAndColorThemes.git
   ```

3. ðŸŽ‰ Restart the Xcode. Now you can use the new theme named `milespass` in `Fonts & Colors` section in preferences.
